## Areas for Improvement

- ⚠️ Clinical impression could include more specific diagnostic criteria being met (e.g., specific GAD symptoms observed)
- ⚠️ Consider adding treatment goal progress ratings or specific outcome measures being tracked
- ⚠️ The objective section could benefit from mental status exam language for more standardized documentation
- ⚠️ Session number and treatment phase could be more prominently documented for continuity tracking

## Prompt Engineering Suggestions

The following changes to the system prompt could improve future generations:

1. Add instruction to include specific DSM-5 criteria observations in the clinical impression section
2. Include prompt for standardized mental status exam elements in the objective section (orientation, memory, judgment, etc.)
3. Add guidance to reference specific treatment goals and progress metrics when available
4. Consider adding a field for session number and total planned sessions to track treatment phase
5. Include instruction to note any coordination of care or consultation activities
