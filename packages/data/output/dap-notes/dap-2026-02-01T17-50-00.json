  "data": {
    "subjective": "Client reports ongoing anxiety related to workplace stress and upcoming performance review. States she has been 'having a really hard time sleeping' due to worry about the review. Reports fear that 'any feedback that isn't glowing means I'm going to get fired.' Acknowledges the breathing exercises from previous session have been 'helping somewhat' and she has been using them before meetings. Describes difficulty declining additional work from supervisor due to fear of being perceived as 'not a team player.' Notes physical symptoms include tension and sleep disruption.",
    "objective": "34-year-old female arrived on time, well-groomed with visible signs of physical tension including shoulder rigidity and fidgeting behaviors. Maintained good eye contact throughout session. Speech was slightly rapid, particularly when discussing work-related content. Affect anxious but mood-congruent. Client was engaged and participated actively in all interventions. Demonstrated ability to identify automatic thoughts and examine evidence during cognitive restructuring exercise. Successfully completed 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique with observable reduction in physical tension. This is session 6 of ongoing treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder."
  },
  "assessment": {
    "clinicalImpression": "Client continues to meet criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder with workplace stress as primary trigger. Cognitive distortions are evident, particularly catastrophic thinking and perfectionism patterns. Client demonstrates good insight into the connection between her thinking patterns and anxiety symptoms. She shows strong engagement in treatment and willingness to apply learned skills between sessions. The anxiety-perfectionism-avoidance cycle remains a core treatment target.",
    "progress": "Client is making steady progress toward treatment goals. She has successfully implemented breathing techniques for anxiety management with reported benefit. Cognitive restructuring skills are developing - client was able to identify and challenge catastrophic thoughts about performance review during session. Insight into perfectionism patterns is increasing. Continued difficulty with boundary-setting at work indicates this remains an area requiring focused intervention.",
    "riskAssessment": "No current safety concerns. Client denies suicidal ideation, self-harm urges, or homicidal ideation. Sleep disruption is present but attributed to anxiety about upcoming review rather than depression. No substance use concerns reported. Client has adequate social support and coping resources. Risk level assessed as low."

    "homework": "Complete thought records focusing on situations where perfectionism is triggered, specifically noting automatic thoughts, evidence for/against, and alternative balanced thoughts. Conduct behavioral experiment by declining one small additional task from supervisor and documenting predicted vs. actual outcomes.",
    "nextSession": "Continue cognitive restructuring work targeting perfectionism-related automatic thoughts. Review behavioral experiment results and process client's experience with boundary-setting. If experiment successful, plan gradual expansion of assertiveness behaviors. Begin exploration of core beliefs underlying perfectionism patterns.",
