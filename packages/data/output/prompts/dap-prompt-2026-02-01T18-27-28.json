  "user": "# Session to Document\n\nPlease generate a complete DAP note for the following therapy session. The therapist has described the session as follows:\n\n---\n\nI had my sixth session today with Sarah, my client dealing with generalized anxiety and work stress. She came in looking pretty tense - you could see it in her shoulders and she was fidgeting with her phone in the waiting room. But she was engaged and ready to work, which is great.\n\nWe spent the first part of the session reviewing how her week went. She said the breathing exercises we worked on last time have been helping somewhat - she's been using them before meetings and it takes the edge off. But she mentioned she's been having a really hard time sleeping because her performance review is coming up next month.\n\nWhen we dug into what's keeping her up, it became clear she's caught in this cycle of catastrophic thinking. She's convinced that any feedback that isn't glowing means she's going to get fired, even though rationally she knows her work has been solid. Classic anxiety pattern - her mind jumps to the worst case scenario.\n\nSo we did some cognitive restructuring work. I had her walk me through her automatic thoughts about the review, and we examined the evidence for and against them. She was actually able to identify that she got promoted last year, her manager has given her positive feedback recently, and she's never actually received a poor review. By the end she could see that her prediction of being fired was anxiety talking, not reality.\n\nThe other big thing we tackled was her difficulty saying no to her supervisor. He's been piling extra projects on her, and she just keeps saying yes because she's afraid of being seen as not a team player. We talked about how this feeds her anxiety - more work means more stress, less sleep, worse anxiety. We planned out a behavioral experiment where she's going to try declining one small additional task this week and observe what actually happens versus what she fears will happen.\n\nWe ended with a grounding exercise because she was getting activated talking about work. The 5-4-3-2-1 technique worked well for her. I assigned thought records as homework so we can have more material to work with next session, specifically focused on situations where she notices the perfectionism showing up.\n\nOverall I'm pleased with her progress. She's developing good insight into her patterns and is willing to try new things. I want to keep building on the cognitive work and start looking at the deeper beliefs about needing to be perfect that seem to be driving a lot of this.\n\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\nBased on the session description above, generate a comprehensive DAP note that:\n\n1. **Data Section**:\n   - Extract subjective information the client shared\n   - Note objective clinical observations mentioned by the therapist\n   - Include direct quotes from the client when mentioned\n\n2. **Assessment Section**:\n   - Provide a clinical impression synthesizing the session data\n   - Evaluate progress toward treatment goals\n   - ALWAYS include a risk assessment (even if to note \"no acute safety concerns\")\n\n3. **Plan Section**:\n   - List specific interventions used and planned\n   - Include any homework or between-session assignments\n   - Describe focus areas for the next session\n   - Note any referrals if mentioned\n\n4. **Metadata**:\n   - Infer the session date if mentioned, otherwise use today's date\n   - Estimate session duration based on content (default to 50 minutes if unclear)\n   - Identify session type (individual, couples, family, telehealth)\n   - Suggest an appropriate CPT billing code\n\nGenerate the DAP note with clinical precision and appropriate professional language suitable for insurance documentation.",
