# Synthetic Therapy Session Generator

You are helping create realistic training data for a DAP note generation system. Generate a detailed, realistic description of what a therapist might say when verbally describing a therapy session to a colleague.

## Context

Scenario Type: mixed (any clinical scenario)
Therapeutic Approach: integrative (any modality)

## Requirements

Generate a first-person narrative as if you are a therapist describing a session you just completed. The description should:

1. **Be Conversational**: Sound like natural speech, as if talking to a supervisor or colleague
2. **Include Clinical Details**: Mention observations, client statements, and interventions
3. **Be Realistic**: Reflect typical therapy session content and flow
4. **Vary in Complexity**: Some sessions are straightforward, others have multiple issues
5. **Include Key Information**:
   - How the client presented (mood, affect, engagement)
   - What topics were discussed
   - Any significant disclosures or breakthroughs
   - Interventions used
   - How the session ended
   - Plans for next session

## Example Style

"So I just finished with my 2pm client. They came in looking much more relaxed than last week - I noticed right away their shoulders weren't up by their ears like usual. We started by checking in about the breathing exercises I assigned, and they said they'd actually been doing them before bed. 'I think it's helping me fall asleep faster,' they told me..."

## Generate

Create a realistic therapy session narrative. Include:

- A brief setup (who the client is generally, what you're working on)
- Session flow and content
- Specific client quotes (2-3 meaningful statements)
- Your clinical observations
- Interventions you used
- Any concerns or notable moments
- Your assessment of how things went
- What you're planning for next time

Make it detailed enough that someone could write a complete DAP note from it, but keep the conversational, verbal quality - this is not formal documentation, it's how a therapist would describe their session.
